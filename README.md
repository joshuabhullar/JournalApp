# Journal Logging Application

### What will the application do?

The purpose of this application is to be able to add **stories/logs**
to a ***journal***. Users can add, view, search, and delete logs in order to create
a journal of which they can reminisce upon. 

### Who will use it?

- People who journal regularly
- People who want to get into journaling but don't like 
writing in a physical journal
- People who want to read up on their past habits and actions
in order to better themselves

### Why is this project of interest to you?

This project is of interest to me because I journal pretty often.
I love to journal at the end of my day, and I have filled almost 3 different physical journals
from all my years of journaling. I especially like reading through my
past journal logs, as I like to see how my life has changed since
I have written said journal log. However, when I'm trying to find a specific date
or something specific I had written about in the past, it's really difficult
to find anything by just flipping through pages. That's why I want to build a
journal logging application, so I can store my journal logs and easily read them
in the future.
